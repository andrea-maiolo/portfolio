        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hello and welcome to my personal profile! <br>
          I am Andrea Maiolo, a newcomer to the web development field. Though I may be lacking in experience, I am eager to learn and bring my passion to the craft.<br>
          I have studied the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am familiar with the React framework.<br>
          I understand the importance of clear communication and teamwork, and I am committed to improving my skills and delivering projects of the highest quality.<br>
          I spend my free time reading about web development, trying out new tools and techniques, playing videogames and working out.<br>
          I am confident that, with hard work and determination, I can grow as a web developer and make a positive contribution to the industry.<br>
          If you are looking for a driven and enthusiastic web developer, I would be excited to apply my skills to your next project.<br>
          Let us bring your vision to life.

            <h4>Rock, paper, scissors game</h4>
            <p>
              This project is a basic game of the game rock paper scissors(rps), from The Odin Project.<br>
              With this project, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using JS for functions, loops and conditionals statements and teh DOM.<br>
              You can play the game simply interacting with your mouse on the screen.<br>
              Hope you like it and may you win!<br>
