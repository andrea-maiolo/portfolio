## About Me

Front end developer fueled by passion to learn and create
I am Andrea Maiolo, a 28 years old Italian Front-end developer.
What I love about coding is its nature of problem-solving, continuously presenting new puzzles for me to figure out.
Web development, in particular, combines the creative process of designing with the technical aspect of bringing to life a project.
As a Junior Front-End Developer, I learned skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React; which I use to bring to life websites that are responsive and that offer a smooth user experience.
Actually for hire.

## Projects

Here are some projects that I did while learning technologies like Javascript and React.
